# RuneLingual - All-in-one translation plugin

RuneLingual is a plugin for Old School RuneScape (OSRS), powered by the officially-supported RuneLite game client. It provides a comprehensive and user-friendly translation feature for the game. Players from around the world can enjoy the game in their preferred language by translating in-game text, messages, UI, and even experience dynamic on-the-fly translations.

<p style="text-align:center; font-style: italic;">Completely free for the end user, forever.</p>


## Features

- **Language Selection:** Choose your preferred language from our pack and experience OSRS in your own language.
- **Customization:** Tailor the translation of elements based on your preferences.
- **Real-time Translation (early in development):** Translates player-sent messages and many other dynamic elements.
