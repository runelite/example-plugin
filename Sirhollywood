So I don't know how to ask for a plugin to be made or is im doing this thread right. is there anyway someone could me a interface change to horizantal instead of vertical? Inventory, Prayer, and everything that deals with f keys run horizantal, sometimes running resizable mode you can't see npc's or minions from bosses and so on because teh inventory is blocking the FOV so if you were to change it horizantal i feel there wuold be more fov. again I'm new here if anyone could help or havea discussion about this!?
